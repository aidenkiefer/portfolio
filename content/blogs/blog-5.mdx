# Exploring Memvid: Video-Based Memory for AI Systems

Recently, I came across an open-source project called **Memvid**, which takes a very unconventional approach to long-term memory for AI systems. I wouldn’t call myself an expert on it by any means, but after skimming the docs, reading through the repository, and experimenting with a small example, I found the core idea interesting enough to keep thinking about.

Memvid isn’t positioned as a polished production tool; it feels more like an exploration of a design space. That’s exactly the kind of project that tends to stick with me.

---

## What is Memvid?

At a high level, Memvid is a **video-based memory system** for AI applications.

Instead of storing embeddings in a hosted vector database, the system takes a different path:

```documents → embeddings → QR codes → video file → semantic search```

More concretely, Memvid:

- breaks text into chunks  
- converts each chunk into an embedding  
- encodes those embeddings as QR codes  
- stitches the QR codes into a compressed video file (e.g., MP4)  

That video file becomes the “memory store.” When a query is run, the video is decoded and searched to retrieve relevant chunks.

It’s a strange idea on first read, but also kind of compelling once you sit with it.

---

## Why this caught my attention

Most modern AI memory systems converge on similar architectures:

- embeddings
- vector databases
- hosted services
- indexing pipelines

Memvid deliberately avoids that stack. Everything stays **local**, stored in a single artifact that can be copied, archived, or shared like any other media file.

What stood out to me immediately:

- No external database dependency  
- Memory represented as a durable file  
- A workflow that’s easy to reason about end-to-end  
- An intentionally constrained, physical representation of memory  

Even if this approach never becomes mainstream, it forces you to think differently about what “memory” actually means in AI systems.

## A very small example

Here’s a simplified example based on what I experimented with after reading the docs.

```python
from memvid import Memvid

mem = Memvid()

# Add some documents
mem.add_text("I studied databases, operating systems, and machine learning.")
mem.add_text("My senior project focused on time-series forecasting.")
mem.add_text("I enjoy systems design and performance optimization.")

# Build the video-based memory
mem.build("memory.mp4")

# Run a query
results = mem.find("What database topics did I study?", k=5)
print(results["hits"])```

## A use case I keep thinking about: accessibility and course materials

One use case that stood out to me isn’t strictly “AI agent” related, but **student accessibility**.

Course materials tend to be scattered across platforms:

- lecture slides  
- PDFs  
- recorded videos  
- discussion posts  
- personal notes  

For students with cognitive or learning disabilities, navigating that fragmentation can be exhausting. Even for students without accessibility needs, remembering *where* something was covered is often harder than understanding the content itself.

I can imagine a workflow where:

- course materials are chunked and embedded  
- stored locally as a Memvid video file  
- paired with structured metadata (course, week, topic)  
- queried conversationally or via assistive tools  

Instead of asking *“Which PDF was that in?”*, a student could ask:

> “What did we cover about database normalization before the midterm?”

And receive grounded, source-linked answers, without relying on cloud-hosted services, accounts, or complex infrastructure.

Even if Memvid itself isn’t the final solution, the idea of **portable, local semantic memory** feels especially relevant in accessibility-focused contexts.

---

## Limitations and open questions

There are real tradeoffs here, and I don’t want to gloss over them:

- performance at scale is unclear  
- video encoding and decoding introduces overhead  
- observability and debugging look very different than traditional systems  
- it’s not obvious how this fits into production pipelines  

Memvid doesn’t pretend to solve all of these problems, and that’s okay.

---

## Why I’m glad projects like this exist

What I appreciate most about Memvid is that it feels like a **question more than an answer**.

- What if memory didn’t live in a database?  
- What if portability mattered more than raw throughput?  
- What if constraints actually led to clearer systems?  

Even if I never use Memvid directly, it’s influenced how I think about AI systems, storage, and architectural tradeoffs. And for me, that alone makes it worth paying attention to.

If nothing else, it’s a reminder that interesting engineering often starts by asking slightly uncomfortable questions.
