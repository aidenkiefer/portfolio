## Problem / Context

People with food allergies struggle to quickly identify allergens in food products. During CodeDay, we built a solution to scan ingredient lists and highlight potential allergens.

## Approach / Design

**Frontend**: React app with:
- Image upload for product labels
- OCR integration for text extraction
- Real-time allergen highlighting
- User profile for saved allergens

**Backend**: Node.js/Express API:
- Ingredient parsing and matching
- Allergen database
- User authentication

## Key Decisions / Tradeoffs

**OCR Service**: Used a third-party OCR API rather than building our own to save development time during the hackathon.

**Database**: Started with JSON files, migrated to PostgreSQL for production-readiness.

**Time Constraints**: Focused on core functionality (scanning and detection) over advanced features (meal planning, recipe suggestions).

## Results

- Successfully deployed working prototype
- Won "Best Social Impact" award at CodeDay
- Processed 100+ ingredient scans during demo

## What I'd Improve

1. **Accuracy**: Improve OCR accuracy for handwritten or low-quality images
2. **Database**: Expand allergen database with more comprehensive ingredient mappings
3. **Mobile App**: Build native mobile app for better camera integration
4. **Offline Mode**: Add offline capability for scanned products
