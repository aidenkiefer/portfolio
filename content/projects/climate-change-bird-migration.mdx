## Problem / Context

Climate change is affecting bird migration patterns worldwide. Understanding these changes is crucial for conservation efforts and predicting future impacts on ecosystems.

This project aimed to:
- Analyze historical climate and bird migration data
- Build predictive models to forecast migration patterns
- Provide insights for conservation planning through 2050

## Approach / Design

I collected and processed data from two primary sources:
- **eBird**: Citizen science bird observation data
- **NOAA**: Historical climate data (temperature, precipitation)

The analysis pipeline included:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering (seasonal patterns, temperature trends)
3. Model training using multiple regression approaches
4. Validation on recent data (2005-2024)
5. Forecasting future migration patterns

## Key Decisions / Tradeoffs

**Model Selection**: I chose linear regression and random forest models over deep learning approaches because:
- Interpretability was important for conservation stakeholders
- The dataset size didn't justify the complexity of neural networks
- Faster training allowed for more experimentation

**Data Splitting**: I used a temporal split (1961-2005 for training, 2005-2024 for validation) rather than random splitting to better simulate real-world forecasting scenarios.

## Results

The models successfully identified key climate factors affecting migration timing:
- Temperature increases correlate with earlier spring migrations
- Precipitation patterns influence stopover locations
- Forecasts suggest significant shifts in migration routes by 2050

Validation on 2005-2024 data showed strong predictive performance, with R² scores above 0.75 for most species.

## What I'd Improve

1. **Data Quality**: Incorporate more granular location data to improve spatial predictions
2. **Model Ensemble**: Combine multiple models for more robust forecasts
3. **Real-time Updates**: Build a pipeline to continuously update predictions as new data arrives
4. **Visualization**: Create interactive maps showing predicted migration routes
