summary: "Designed and implemented a normalized database schema for hospital management system."
highlights:
  - "Third normal form (3NF) normalization"
  - "Complex relationships between patients, doctors, appointments, and records"

## Problem / Context

Design a database schema for a hospital management system that efficiently stores and retrieves information about patients, doctors, appointments, medical records, and billing.

## Approach / Design

I followed database design best practices:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Identified all entities and their relationships
2. **ER Modeling**: Created entity-relationship diagrams
3. **Normalization**: Applied 3NF to eliminate redundancy
4. **Implementation**: Created PostgreSQL schema with proper constraints

Key entities included:
- Patients
- Doctors
- Departments
- Appointments
- Medical Records
- Billing

## Key Decisions / Tradeoffs

**Normalization Level**: Chose 3NF over higher normal forms to balance query performance with data integrity. Some denormalization was acceptable for frequently accessed data.

**Indexing Strategy**: Created indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns (patient ID, appointment dates) to optimize read performance.

## Results

The database design:
- Eliminated data redundancy
- Maintained referential integrity
- Supported complex queries efficiently
- Handled concurrent access scenarios

## What I'd Improve

1. **Partitioning**: Implement table partitioning for large historical data
2. **Caching Layer**: Add Redis for frequently accessed patient information
3. **Audit Trail**: Implement comprehensive logging for compliance
