## Problem / Context

Understanding how decision trees work at a fundamental level by implementing the ID3 algorithm from scratch, without relying on existing machine learning libraries.

## Approach / Design

I implemented the core ID3 algorithm components:
- **Entropy calculation**: Measuring information gain
- **Tree construction**: Recursive splitting based on information gain
- **Prediction**: Traversing the tree for classification

The implementation handles:
- Categorical features
- Missing values
- Tree pruning to prevent overfitting

## Key Decisions / Tradeoffs

**Information Gain vs. Gini Impurity**: I chose information gain (entropy-based) as it's the standard for ID3, though Gini impurity can be faster to compute.

**Pruning Strategy**: Implemented both pre-pruning (max depth) and post-pruning to balance model complexity and accuracy.

## Results

The implementation successfully:
- Classified test data with 85% accuracy
- Demonstrated clear understanding of decision tree mechanics
- Provided interpretable decision rules

## What I'd Improve

1. **Continuous Features**: Extend to handle continuous/numeric features
2. **Visualization**: Add tree visualization for better interpretability
3. **Performance**: Optimize for larger datasets
