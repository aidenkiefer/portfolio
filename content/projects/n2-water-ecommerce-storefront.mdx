## Overview

A production e-commerce platform built with React and Next.js, integrating Shopify APIs and operating under real business constraints. The goal was to build a performant, maintainable storefront that supported marketing, SEO, and customer workflows while integrating with existing e-commerce infrastructure.

## Problem & Context

The goal was to build a performant, maintainable storefront that supported marketing, SEO, and customer workflows while integrating with existing e-commerce infrastructure. This project involved building a custom storefront to replace an outdated platform, requiring careful balance between technical excellence and business requirements.

Building a production e-commerce storefront requires balancing technical excellence with business requirements, marketing needs, and SEO constraints. The challenge was maintaining engineering standards while collaborating with non-technical stakeholders.

## Constraints

- Real users and live traffic requiring high reliability
- SEO requirements for search engine visibility
- Third-party API limitations (Shopify Storefront API)
- Non-technical stakeholders needing to manage content
- Performance requirements for fast page loads
- Budget and timeline constraints

## Approach & Design Decisions

I made architectural decisions around rendering strategies, API usage, and performance optimization, balancing development speed with long-term maintainability:

1. **Next.js Architecture**: Leveraged server-side rendering and static generation for performance and SEO
2. **Shopify Integration**: Used Shopify Storefront API for product data and inventory management
3. **TypeScript**: Ensured type safety across the application
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented code splitting, image optimization, and caching strategies
5. **SEO Considerations**: Structured data, meta tags, and semantic HTML

**Rendering Strategy**: I chose Next.js with SSR/SSG because it provides better SEO than client-side only rendering, improved initial load performance, and flexibility to mix rendering strategies per page.

**Shopify Integration**: Using Shopify Storefront API rather than building a custom backend leveraged existing product management infrastructure, reduced maintenance burden, and enabled non-technical team members to manage products.

## Implementation Highlights

- **Shopify Storefront API Integration**: Seamless integration with Shopify for product data and inventory
- **SSR vs CSR Tradeoffs**: Strategic use of server-side and client-side rendering based on page needs
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, image optimization, and caching strategies
- **SEO Implementation**: Structured data, meta tags, and semantic HTML for search visibility
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Effective communication with non-technical team members

## Results & Evaluation

The site supports live users, marketing campaigns, and ongoing iteration, demonstrating production-level engineering. The platform successfully:

- Replaced the outdated storefront with a modern, performant solution
- Integrated seamlessly with Shopify for product management
- Achieved strong SEO performance and search visibility
- Maintained engineering quality while meeting business requirements

The project demonstrated ability to work with real-world constraints, balance technical and business needs, maintain production systems, and collaborate effectively with non-technical stakeholders.

## Tradeoffs & Limitations

- **Platform Constraints**: Platform constraints imposed by Shopify API limitations
- **Rapid Iteration vs. Technical Debt**: Balancing rapid iteration with long-term maintainability
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Reliance on Shopify API for core functionality
- **Performance vs. Features**: Tradeoffs between feature development and performance optimization

## What I Learned

Production systems require technical judgment, communication, and the ability to work within constraints. Key insights:

1. **Production Systems**: Maintaining live systems requires careful planning, monitoring, and iteration
2. **Stakeholder Communication**: Translating technical decisions for non-technical audiences is essential
3. **Performance Optimization**: Real-world performance requires ongoing measurement and optimization
4. **API Integration**: Working with third-party APIs requires robust error handling, caching, and fallback strategies

The experience reinforced that production engineering is as much about communication and judgment as it is about technical skills.
