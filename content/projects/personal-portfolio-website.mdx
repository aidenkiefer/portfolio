## Overview

This portfolio website represents a complete rethinking of how to present engineering work online. Rather than a simple gallery of projects, I built a content-first platform that emphasizes case studies, design decisions, and engineering thinking. The site demonstrates my approach to systems design, content architecture, and building maintainable web applications.

## Problem & Context

Traditional portfolio sites often feel like marketing pages: flashy but shallow, emphasizing visuals over substance. For someone pursuing software engineering roles, I needed a site that:

- Showcases not just what I built, but how I think about problems
- Allows employers to search and filter by specific technologies or skills
- Maintains credibility and professionalism without feeling corporate
- Scales easily as I add new projects and experience
- Performs well and remains maintainable over time

The challenge was balancing depth with clarity, creating a system that could handle both detailed case studies and quick scanning, while maintaining a calm, engineer-oriented aesthetic.

## Constraints

- **Content-first approach**: The design must support long-form case studies and structured data
- **Performance**: Fast load times and excellent SEO for recruiter discovery
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add new projects, update content, and evolve the design
- **Responsive design**: Works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop without feeling cramped or overly wide
- **Accessibility**: Meets WCAG standards and works for all users
- **Budget**: Free or low-cost hosting (Vercel free tier)

## Approach & Design Decisions

### Architecture: Next.js App Router

I chose Next.js 16 with the App Router for several reasons:

1. **Static Generation**: All pages are pre-rendered at build time, ensuring fast load times and excellent SEO
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout provides compile-time safety and better developer experience
3. **File-based Routing**: The App Router's file-based system makes adding new pages intuitive
4. **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, font loading, and metadata management are handled automatically

### Content Architecture: Hybrid Approach

Rather than choosing between a CMS or static files, I implemented a hybrid system:

- **MDX for Case Studies**: Project case studies are written in MDX, allowing rich formatting, code blocks, and embedded React components
- **TypeScript Modules for Structured Data**: Experience, coursework, and skills are defined in TypeScript files, providing type safety and easy updates
- **Separation of Concerns**: Content lives in `content/` and `data/` directories, separate from presentation logic

This approach gives me the flexibility of markdown for long-form content while maintaining type safety and structure for data-driven pages.

### Design System: TailwindCSS 4 with Custom Theme

I migrated to TailwindCSS 4's new CSS-first approach, defining a custom theme using the `@theme` directive:

- **Color System**: Warm, paper-like background with muted navy and brick red accents
- **Typography**: IBM Plex Sans for body text, IBM Plex Mono for code
- **Spacing & Layout**: Responsive spacing that scales from mobile to desktop
- **Components**: Reusable components (BadgeRow, SectionHeading, ChipMark) that maintain consistency

The design system prioritizes clarity and readability over visual flair, aligning with the site's content-first philosophy.

### Search Functionality

I implemented a custom search system that allows filtering by:

- **Keywords**: Searches across titles, descriptions, content, and tech stacks
- **Tags**: Click any technology tag to see all projects/experience using that technology
- **Type Filtering**: Filter to show only projects or only experience
- **Relevance Scoring**: Results are sorted by relevance, with exact tag matches scoring highest

The search API route handles server-side processing, while the search page uses client-side state management for responsive filtering.

### Responsive Design Strategy

Following the dynamic spacing guidelines, I implemented a two-tier container system:

- **Wide Page Containers**: `max-w-7xl` for sections and grids, allowing content to use available width on desktop
- **Prose Containers**: `max-w-prose` for long-form text, maintaining optimal reading width
- **Responsive Grids**: Project cards scale from 1 column (mobile) to 2 columns (tablet) to 3 columns (desktop)
- **Typography Scaling**: Headings and spacing scale responsively across breakpoints

This approach prevents the "skinny center column" problem on desktop while maintaining readability.

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

The site uses a modular component structure:

- **Layout Components**: Navbar, Footer, Container handle site-wide structure
- **Common Components**: BadgeRow, SectionHeading, ChipMark provide reusable UI elements
- **Project Components**: ProjectCard, ProjectMeta, ProjectNavigation handle project-specific displays
- **Search Components**: SearchableBadge enables tag-based navigation

Each component is typed with TypeScript and follows consistent styling patterns.

### MDX Processing

Project case studies are processed using `next-mdx-remote` with:

- **remark-gfm**: GitHub Flavored Markdown support for tables, strikethrough, etc.
- **rehype-pretty-code**: Syntax highlighting for code blocks with the GitHub Dark theme
- **Custom Components**: MDX components for consistent formatting of code blocks, links, and other elements

This setup allows me to write case studies in markdown while maintaining full control over rendering.

### Search Implementation

The search system consists of:

1. **Search Utility** (`lib/search.ts`): Relevance scoring algorithm that weights different match types
2. **API Route** (`app/api/search/route.ts`): Server-side endpoint that processes search queries
3. **Search Page** (`app/search/page.tsx`): Client-side interface with filtering and results display

The relevance algorithm prioritizes:
- Exact tag matches (100 points)
- Title/role matches (50 points)
- Summary matches (30 points)
- Tech stack matches (20 points per match)
- Content matches (10 points per match, capped)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Static Generation**: All pages are pre-rendered at build time
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with AVIF format support
- **Font Loading**: IBM Plex fonts loaded with `display: swap` for performance
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting via Next.js App Router
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Client-side JavaScript only where needed (search, interactive elements)

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: MDX Build Configuration

**Problem**: Initial setup with `@next/mdx` caused build errors on Vercel due to serialization issues.

**Solution**: Switched to `next-mdx-remote` for runtime MDX processing, removing the need for build-time MDX compilation. This simplified the configuration and resolved the build errors.

### Challenge: TailwindCSS v4 Migration

**Problem**: TailwindCSS v4 introduced a new CSS-first approach, breaking existing custom color utilities.

**Solution**: Migrated to the `@theme` directive in `globals.css`, defining all custom colors, fonts, and animations as CSS variables. This approach is more maintainable and aligns with TailwindCSS v4's philosophy.

### Challenge: Responsive Design Without Feeling Narrow

**Problem**: Initial design used `max-w-3xl` containers, making the site feel cramped on desktop.

**Solution**: Implemented two-tier container system: wide containers (`max-w-7xl`) for sections and grids, prose containers (`max-w-prose`) for text. This allows grids and cards to expand on desktop while keeping text readable.

### Challenge: Search Functionality Without External Services

**Problem**: Needed search functionality but wanted to avoid external services or complex indexing.

**Solution**: Built a simple but effective server-side search API that processes queries against all projects and experience entries. The relevance scoring algorithm provides good results without requiring a search index.

## What I Learned

Building this site reinforced several important lessons:

1. **Content Architecture Matters**: The decision to use MDX for case studies and TypeScript for structured data has made adding new content straightforward and type-safe.

2. **Design Systems Scale**: Investing time in a well-defined design system (colors, typography, spacing, components) pays off as the site grows. Changes can be made globally by updating the system.

3. **Performance is a Feature**: Static generation and image optimization mean the site loads quickly even with rich content. This improves both user experience and SEO.

4. **Search Enhances Discovery**: The tag-based search functionality makes it easy for employers to find specific examples of technologies or skills, which is valuable for a portfolio site.

5. **Responsive Design Requires Planning**: The two-tier container system wasn't obvious initially, but it solved the "skinny column" problem elegantly. Planning responsive behavior upfront saves refactoring later.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements I'm considering:

- **Analytics**: Add privacy-focused analytics to understand how visitors use the site
- **RSS Feed**: Generate an RSS feed for case studies
- **Dark Mode**: Optional dark mode that maintains the warm, paper-like aesthetic
- **Project Filtering**: Add more sophisticated filtering options on the projects page
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track Core Web Vitals and optimize further if needed

## Reflection

This project represents a significant investment in thinking through how to present engineering work online. Rather than building a simple gallery, I created a system that can grow with my career while maintaining clarity and professionalism.

The site demonstrates several engineering principles: thoughtful architecture, maintainable code, performance optimization, and user-centered design. It's a meta-project: a portfolio about building portfolios, showcasing not just what I can build, but how I approach building things.
