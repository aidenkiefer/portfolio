## Problem / Context

Community organizations need websites that are easy to maintain, accessible to diverse audiences, and integrate with external systems for events, donations, and communications.

This project required:
- Building a dynamic, content-driven website
- Integrating with third-party systems (event management, donations)
- Balancing usability, accessibility, and long-term maintainability
- Supporting non-technical content updates

## Approach / Design

I built the website using WordPress as the foundation, with:

1. **Custom Frontend**: Developed custom themes and templates for specific needs
2. **Third-Party Integration**: Integrated external systems for events and donations
3. **Accessibility**: Ensured WCAG compliance for broad audience access
4. **Content Management**: Designed content structure for easy updates by non-technical users

## Key Decisions / Tradeoffs

**WordPress Choice**: Using WordPress because:
- Non-technical team members could update content
- Rich plugin ecosystem for integrations
- Lower maintenance burden than custom CMS

**Custom Development**: Customizing rather than using off-the-shelf themes:
- Met specific organizational needs
- Maintained design consistency
- Enabled future flexibility

**Accessibility Focus**: Prioritizing accessibility:
- Ensured broad audience access
- Met legal compliance requirements
- Improved overall user experience

## Technical Implementation

## Results

The website successfully:
- Served as the primary online presence for the organization
- Integrated seamlessly with external systems
- Remained accessible and usable for diverse audiences
- Supported ongoing content updates by non-technical team members

The project demonstrated:
- Ability to work within platform constraints
- Skill in balancing technical and user needs
- Experience maintaining production websites
- Understanding of accessibility requirements

## What I Learned

1. **Platform Constraints**: Working within platform limitations requires creative solutions
2. **Long-Term Maintenance**: Production sites require ongoing attention and updates
3. **User Experience**: Balancing technical capabilities with user needs
4. **Accessibility**: Building accessible sites improves experience for all users

## What I'd Improve

1. **Performance**: Optimize page load times and reduce plugin overhead
2. **Security**: Implement additional security measures and regular updates
3. **Documentation**: Create maintenance guides for future developers
4. **Testing**: Add automated testing for critical functionality
