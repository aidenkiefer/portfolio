# Contact Page — Content & Intent

This file defines the structure, tone, and written content for the Contact page.

The purpose of this page is to:
- make it easy to reach me
- clarify *why* someone might want to reach out
- feel welcoming, professional, and low-pressure

This page should not feel like:
- a sales funnel
- a generic “let’s connect” page
- an afterthought

It should feel intentional and human.

## 1. Page Title & Intro

### Page Title (H1)
Contact

> Keep this simple and expected.
> No clever variations needed.

---

### Intro Paragraph (Below Title)

I’m actively seeking software engineering roles in Chicago and open to conversations about full-time positions, engineering teams, and projects that value thoughtful design and strong fundamentals. I’m also happy to connect with other engineers for technical discussions or collaboration.

> This paragraph should:
> - clearly state job-seeking intent
> - signal seriousness without desperation
> - set expectations for the types of outreach welcome

## 2. “Reasons to Reach Out” (Implicit or Explicit)

The copy on this page should make it clear that reaching out is appropriate for:

- Software engineering roles (SWE / SWE-adjacent)
- Entry-level or early-career positions
- Teams working in:
  - systems
  - web applications
  - data or ML-adjacent engineering
- Recruiters or hiring managers in the Chicago area
- Engineers interested in discussing:
  - projects
  - system design
  - technical tradeoffs
  - collaboration

This does not need to be a literal bullet list on the page, but the tone should imply these use cases.

## 3. Contact Methods

Each contact method should:
- be clearly labeled
- feel equally valid
- avoid visual hierarchy that discourages use

---

### Email

**Label:** Email  
**Context:** Direct contact for roles, opportunities, and professional conversations.

This should feel like the primary and most serious option.

---

### LinkedIn

**Label:** LinkedIn  
**Context:** Professional networking, recruiting conversations, and industry connections.

This reassures recruiters who prefer platform-based outreach.

---

### GitHub

**Label:** GitHub  
**Context:** Viewing code, projects, and technical work.

This reinforces technical credibility and invites deeper inspection.

## 4. Tone & Writing Guidelines

Tone should be:
- approachable
- professional
- confident
- low-pressure

Writing principles:
- Be explicit about openness to roles
- Avoid “sales” language
- Avoid overly casual phrasing
- Avoid desperation or urgency

Good signals:
- “open to conversations”
- “happy to connect”
- “interested in discussing”

Avoid:
- “Let’s hop on a call!”
- “I’d love to chat!!!”
- Vague enthusiasm without context

## 5. Layout & Presentation Notes (For Cursor)

- This page should be short and breathable
- Contact cards should feel clickable but calm
- Icons should be secondary to text
- Avoid forms unless there’s a strong reason

This page should feel like an open door, not a form submission.

---

## 6. Relationship to the Rest of the Site

This page acts as:
- the final CTA after reading projects or experience
- a low-friction way to continue the conversation

It should reinforce the impression built by:
- the Home page
- Projects
- Experience
- How I Think

---

## 7. Success Criteria

A recruiter or engineer should feel:
- confident that reaching out is appropriate
- clear about why they might contact me
- comfortable choosing any of the listed methods

If someone thinks:
> “This person is clearly open to opportunities and easy to reach.”

Then the page has succeeded.
