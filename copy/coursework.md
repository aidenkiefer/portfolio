# Coursework & Skills Page — Content & Intent

This file defines the structure, tone, and written content for the Coursework & Skills page.

The purpose of this page is to:
- demonstrate strong computer science fundamentals
- show intentional breadth across systems, algorithms, data, and software design
- connect academic coursework to practical skills and projects
- reinforce how formal education has shaped my engineering thinking

This page should feel:
- structured
- academic but accessible
- intentional, not exhaustive

## 1. Page Title & Intro

### Page Title (H1)
Coursework & Skills

> Simple, direct, and descriptive.
> This page is not a transcript dump.

---

### Intro Paragraph (Below Title)

My coursework is curated to show strong computer science fundamentals and exposure across systems, algorithms, machine learning, databases, and UI. These courses have shaped how I think about engineering problems and informed my approach to system design.

> This paragraph should:
> - frame coursework as *thinking training*, not credentials
> - signal rigor without listing everything
> - be readable in under 10 seconds

## 2. Academic Context (Optional Visual Support)

If an image is used (e.g., university campus):
- It should be subtle and secondary
- It should not distract from the text
- It should reinforce academic grounding

The image exists to add context, not decoration.

## 3. Coursework Section (Primary Focus)

### Section Heading (H2)
Coursework

---

### Section Intent

This section organizes coursework by **conceptual area**, not chronology.

The goal is to answer:
> “What foundations does this person actually have?”

Not:
> “What classes did they take?”

---

### Grouping Strategy

Courses should be grouped by theme, such as:
- Core Computer Science
- Systems & Architecture
- Data & Machine Learning
- Software Engineering & UI
- Supporting Mathematics

Each group should:
- Have a clear conceptual identity
- Contain only the most relevant courses

---

### Individual Course Entries

Each course card should include:
- Course code (monospace, small)
- Course name (primary)
- Skills learned (concise badges)
- Optional related project links

Course descriptions should **not** be paragraphs.
Skills learned should be:
- concrete
- technical
- defensible

Examples:
- “Memory management”
- “Relational modeling”
- “Supervised learning”
- “API design”

Avoid:
- vague phrases
- resume padding
- buzzwords

---

### Related Projects

If a course has associated projects:
- Link them clearly
- Treat projects as proof of learning
- Use them to bridge theory → practice

This reinforces that coursework is not isolated from hands-on work.

## 4. Technical Skills Section

### Section Heading (H2)
Technical Skills

---

### Section Intent

This section exists to provide a **quick, scannable overview** of technical tools and domains.

It should:
- complement the coursework section
- reinforce breadth and depth
- be honest and defensible

This is not a “keyword dump.”

---

### Skills Philosophy

Skills listed here should:
- be supported by coursework, projects, or experience
- represent real working knowledge
- be categorized clearly

Avoid listing:
- tools you’ve only briefly touched
- buzzwords without context

---

### Skill Categories

Recommended categories:
- Languages
- Systems
- Web
- Data / Machine Learning
- Tools

Within each category:
- Keep lists concise
- Order skills by familiarity or relevance
- Prefer clarity over completeness

## 5. Relationship to Other Pages

This page should work in concert with:
- Projects (proof of applied knowledge)
- Experience (real-world application)
- Strengths / How I Think (learning philosophy)

It should not stand alone as a credential page.

---

## 6. Tone & Framing Guidelines

Tone should be:
- precise
- grounded
- intellectually honest

Framing principles:
- Coursework trained how I think, not just what I know
- Theory informs practice
- Breadth is intentional, not scattered

Avoid:
- Inflated claims
- Overly casual language
- Talking down to the reader

---

## 7. Layout & Presentation Notes (For Cursor)

- Coursework groups should be clearly separated
- Cards should be consistent in size and structure
- Use borders and spacing, not color, to separate content
- Avoid dense grids with too many items visible at once

The page should feel organized and calm, even though it contains a lot of information.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

A recruiter or engineer should leave this page thinking:
- “This person has real CS fundamentals”
- “They understand systems, not just frameworks”
- “Their academic background clearly informs their engineering work”

If this page increases confidence in my technical foundation, it has succeeded.
