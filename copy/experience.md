# Experience Page — Content & Intent

This file defines the structure, tone, and written content for the Experience page.

The purpose of this page is to:
- demonstrate real-world engineering experience
- reinforce that my work involves systems, structure, and decision-making
- expand upon resume bullets with context and intent

This page should feel grounded, professional, and credible.

---

## 1. Page Title & Intro

### Page Title (H1)
Experience

> Keep this simple and unembellished.
> No subtitles baked into the heading itself.

---

### Intro Paragraph (Immediately Below Heading)

My professional experience reflects engineering work across web development, systems optimization, and data-driven decision making. Each role has involved building and maintaining systems—not just pages—with attention to performance, structure, and measurable impact.

> This paragraph should:
> - set expectations
> - reframe “web / freelance” work as engineering
> - be readable in under 10 seconds

---

## 2. Experience Entry Structure (Repeated per Role)

Each experience entry should be treated as a **case summary**, not just a resume dump.

The visual container should feel:
- structured
- calm
- slightly elevated from the background
- easy to skim

---

### A. Role Header

**Role Title (H2 or H3)**  
Company Name  
Location • Start Date – End Date (or Present)

> Hierarchy matters:
> - Role title is primary
> - Company name is secondary
> - Dates and location are tertiary

---

### B. Experience Summary Bullets

Bullets should:
- describe *what was built*
- emphasize systems, structure, or decisions
- avoid task-only phrasing
- avoid marketing language

Preferred bullet structure:
- Action → System → Impact

Example tone:
- “Designed and implemented…”
- “Built and maintained…”
- “Improved performance by…”
- “Refactored X to support Y…”

Avoid:
- “Helped with…”
- “Worked on…”
- “Responsible for…”

Bullets should be readable individually and skimmable as a group.

### C. Technologies Section

This section exists to:
- ground the work technically
- help recruiters quickly match skills

Guidelines:
- Use concise, recognizable names
- Avoid over-listing tools
- Order technologies by relevance

Label:
**Technologies**

---

### D. Optional Links

If links exist (live site, GitHub, writeup):
- Display them clearly
- Use muted navy for links
- Include a subtle directional cue (arrow)

Label examples:
- View Project
- Visit Site
- View Repository

Links are supplementary, not the focus.

## 3. How This Page Differs from the Resume

This page intentionally:
- adds context missing from a one-page resume
- emphasizes design thinking and systems awareness
- prioritizes clarity over density

The resume is a summary.
This page is explanation.

---

## 4. Tone & Framing Guidelines

Tone should be:
- confident but not inflated
- technical but accessible
- reflective rather than boastful

Framing principles:
- Emphasize ownership and decision-making
- Highlight learning and iteration when relevant
- Treat freelance and internship work as real engineering experience

Avoid:
- Sales language
- Overly casual phrasing
- Vague claims without evidence

---

## 5. Ordering & Emphasis

- Most recent or most relevant experience first
- Prioritize roles that demonstrate:
  - systems thinking
  - technical depth
  - real-world constraints

Older or less relevant roles should still be clear, but not dominate the page.

---

## 6. Layout & Presentation Notes (For Cursor)

- Entries should be clearly separated with whitespace
- Borders should be subtle
- Hover states may exist but must be minimal
- The page should scan vertically without feeling dense

Recommended structure:
- Intro block
- Vertical stack of experience cards
- No timelines or decorative graphics

---

## 7. Success Criteria

A recruiter or engineer should be able to:
- understand the scope of my experience quickly
- see clear evidence of engineering judgment
- distinguish my work from generic “web dev” experience

If someone finishes this page and thinks:
> “This person has actually built and thought about real systems.”

Then the page has succeeded.
