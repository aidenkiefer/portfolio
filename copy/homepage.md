# Home Page — Content & Intent

This file defines the primary landing page content for my personal portfolio website.
The goal of this page is to quickly and clearly communicate:
- who I am
- what kind of engineer I am
- what I work on
- where to go next

This page should feel calm, confident, and intentional.

## 1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)

### Primary Heading (H1)
**Aiden Kiefer**  
Software Engineer

> Keep this large, clear, and unembellished.  
> No taglines above the name. The name is the brand.

---

### Subheading / Elevator Pitch (1–2 lines)

I’m a systems-minded software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience across web development, data science, and machine learning. I care deeply about clarity, thoughtful design, and building software that holds up over time.

> This should be immediately readable and skimmable.
> Avoid buzzwords. Avoid hype.

### Primary Calls to Action (Buttons or Prominent Links)

- **View Projects**
- **View Resume**
- **Contact Me**

> These should be visually prominent but restrained.
> Use muted navy for the primary action.

## 2. Short “About Me” Section

### Section Heading (H2)
About Me

---

### Body Copy

I’m a computer science graduate from the University of Illinois Chicago with a strong interest in systems, software design, and the intersection between theory and real-world engineering. I enjoy working on problems that are ambiguous, design-heavy, and require careful tradeoffs rather than purely mechanical execution.

My background spans core computer science topics like data structures, algorithms, databases, and systems programming, alongside applied work in web development, data science, and machine learning. Across all of it, I tend to gravitate toward understanding how things work under the hood and how individual decisions affect the system as a whole.

I value clarity, communication, and steady improvement. I’m especially motivated by work that rewards thoughtful design, long-term thinking, and collaboration with other engineers.

> Tone: reflective, grounded, and honest.
> Length: short enough to read in ~20–30 seconds.

## 3. Featured Work / Highlights

### Section Heading (H2)
Selected Work

---

### Intro Line (Optional)

A small selection of projects that represent how I think and work as an engineer.

---

### Featured Projects (3 max)

> Each item should link to a full project case study page.

**Climate Change & Bird Migration**  
Data science and machine learning project modeling climate trends and forecasting impacts on bird migration patterns through 2050.

**ID3 Decision Tree (From Scratch)**  
A from-scratch implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm to deeply understand information gain, entropy, and model behavior.

**Database Design & Normalization Project**  
End-to-end relational database design with ER modeling, normalization, SQL queries, and schema justification.

> Cursor should render these as clean cards or list items.
> Emphasize titles and short summaries — not screenshots by default.

## 4. How I Work / What I Value

### Section Heading (H2)
How I Approach Engineering

---

### Body Copy

When I work on software, I focus first on understanding the problem space and the constraints involved. I prefer to think through multiple possible approaches, weigh tradeoffs, and choose solutions that are simple, explainable, and maintainable rather than clever for their own sake.

I enjoy learning new systems and technologies deeply, especially when they expose lower-level details or challenge my assumptions. I also place a high value on communication — writing clear documentation, explaining technical decisions, and making sure others can understand and build on my work.

> This section subtly reflects CliftonStrengths without naming them.

## 5. Experience Snapshot

### Section Heading (H2)
Experience

---

### Body Copy

I’ve worked on real-world software projects in both academic and professional contexts, including freelance and internship-style roles. My experience includes building and maintaining production websites, working with databases and analytics, and collaborating with non-technical stakeholders while maintaining engineering standards.

## 8. Layout & Presentation Notes (For Cursor)

- This page should be vertically spacious and easy to scan
- Avoid large hero images; text is primary
- If an image is used, consider:
  - subtle abstract texture
  - notebook / paper-like background detail
  - no photography by default
- Use section spacing generously
- Headings should be clearly hierarchical but not oversized
- The page should feel calm, not busy

## 9. Success Criteria

A recruiter should be able to:
- Understand who I am in under 30 seconds
- Know where to click next without thinking
- Feel confident that I am thoughtful, capable, and serious about engineering

If someone reads only this page and says:
> “This person thinks clearly and would be good to talk to.”

Then the homepage has done its job.
