### Section 1: Problem → Promise

**Subheading:**  
Tired of answering the same questions over and over?

**Paragraph:**  
Customer support is one of the most draining parts of running a lean business. Your team (or just you) is stuck replying to the same emails, DMs, and contact form submissions. Even worse, leads drop off when they can’t find the answer fast.

Now imagine a smart AI that answers common questions, qualifies leads, and stays online 24/7—without writing any code or hiring support staff.
