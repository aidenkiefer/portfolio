# docs/plans/specs

This folder is for **spec documents** that Cursor/Claude should _read_ as context and constraints, but **not execute directly**.

- Specs describe background, rationale, and rules.
- Tickets (in `docs/plans/tickets/`) describe small, executable tasks.

When writing specs, follow the workflow in `docs/plans/claude-workflow-opt.md`.
