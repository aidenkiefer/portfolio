# docs/plans/tickets

This folder is for **small, concrete tickets** that Claude can execute one at a time.

Each ticket should:

- Target **1–3 concrete changes** max.
- Reference one or more spec docs from `docs/plans/specs/` or other `docs/**`.
- Define **allowed files** and **hard limits** (see `docs/plans/claude-workflow-opt.md`).
- Include clear **done criteria**.

Specs live in `docs/plans/specs/`. Tickets live here.
