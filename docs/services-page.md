# Services Page Instructions for Claude Code

## Overview

Build a modern, conversion-focused **Services** page for my personal portfolio site. The goal of this page is to:
- Attract **startups, solo founders, and small-to-medium businesses**
- Clearly present my **tech-forward freelance offerings**
- Highlight **feature-based, high-impact services** (not vague general freelance dev work)
- Emphasize value, speed of delivery (1–3 sessions), and modern tools like **AI, automation, and performance optimization**

This page should be accessible from the homepage, include strong calls to action, and offer intuitive navigation to individual service pages (linked but not yet implemented).

## Style + UX Notes
- Keep the layout **clean, modern, and mobile-first**
- Use **section headers**, **bold subheadings**, and **clear CTAs**
- Allow each service to link to a full subpage (just route placeholder links like `/services/chatbots`)
- Organize services into clear **categories** as shown below
- Include pricing “**starting at**” figures—these are intentionally reduced (~60% of market low-end) to be highly competitive
