# Positioning & Intent — Personal Portfolio Website

Owner: Aiden Kiefer  
Primary Goal: Market myself as a strong entry-level Software Engineer / SWE-adjacent candidate in Chicago  
Secondary Goal: Provide depth beyond a resume — show how I think, design, and learn as an engineer

This document exists to capture context, intent, tone, and positioning that automated tools may miss.

---

## 1) Audience

Primary:
- Software engineering recruiters
- Hiring managers
- Technical leads reviewing early-career candidates

Secondary:
- Engineers reviewing my GitHub or project work
- Smaller teams / startups looking for thoughtful generalists

Assume:
- Limited time (10–30 seconds initially)
- They expect clarity, professionalism, and technical depth
- They do NOT want gimmicks or flashy UI

---

## 2) Positioning Statement (Core Identity)

I am a **systems-minded software engineer** with experience across:
- web development
- data & machine learning
- databases
- systems programming

My differentiator is not just that I can write code, but that I:
- think in systems and tradeoffs
- learn new technologies deeply
- communicate technical ideas clearly
- enjoy ambiguity and design-heavy problems

This site should reflect **thoughtfulness, clarity, and engineering maturity**, not “portfolio theatrics.”

## 3) Tone & Style Guidelines

**Tone**
- Clear, calm, professional
- Confident but not arrogant
- Reflective rather than boastful

**Avoid**
- Buzzwords without substance
- Overly marketing-driven language
- “Rockstar / ninja / 10x” phrasing
- Excessive animations or visual noise

**Prefer**
- Plain language
- Concrete examples
- Honest reflection (what worked, what didn’t, what I’d improve)

## 4) How Projects Should Be Framed

Projects are **case studies**, not demos.

Each project should emphasize:
1. Problem / motivation
2. Constraints & assumptions
3. Design decisions and tradeoffs
4. Technical implementation
5. Outcomes / results
6. What I learned or would improve next

Even coursework projects should be treated seriously.

Examples of important projects to highlight:
- Climate Change & Bird Migration (data science + ML + forecasting)
- ID3 Decision Tree implementation from scratch
- Database design & normalization project
- Software Engineering I team project
- Personal / freelance web projects (Thrive Vineyard, N-2 Water)

---

## 5) How Coursework Should Be Presented

Coursework is **curated**, not exhaustive.

The goal is to show:
- Strong CS fundamentals
- Exposure to systems, algorithms, ML, databases, and UI
- How coursework influenced my thinking as an engineer

Avoid dumping a transcript.

Organize coursework by **themes**, and link to projects where possible.

---

## 6) Experience Framing

Professional experience should be framed as **engineering work**, even when it intersects with web, SEO, or analytics.

Key ideas:
- I build systems, not just pages
- I care about performance, structure, maintainability, and impact
- Metrics are included when relevant, but not overstated

Internships and freelance work demonstrate:
- real-world constraints
- collaboration
- ownership
- iteration over time

---

## 7) Strengths & “How I Think”

My CliftonStrengths (Strategic, Ideation, Learner, Communication, Positivity) should be translated into:
- how I approach problems
- how I learn new systems
- how I work on teams
- how I communicate technical ideas

This is NOT a personality test page.
It is an explanation of my **engineering mindset**.

---

## 8) Technical & UX Expectations

- Use Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- Content is primary; UI supports it
- Favor readability and structure over visual flair
- Pages should be fast, accessible, and scannable
- MDX is used for long-form content and project case studies

---

## 9) Geographic & Career Context

Target roles:
- Software Engineer I / II
- SWE (Product, Platform, Systems, Data-adjacent)

Location focus:
- Chicago and Chicago-area companies
- Hybrid or in-office preferred, remote acceptable

Avoid positioning toward:
- IT roles
- Marketing roles
- Non-engineering consulting roles

---

## 10) What Success Looks Like

A recruiter should be able to:
- Understand who I am as an engineer in under 30 seconds
- Find my resume immediately
- Dive deep into 1–2 projects and come away impressed by my thinking
- See clear alignment with SWE roles

If a technical lead reads one project case study and says:
> “This person thinks like an engineer — I want to talk to them”

…this site has succeeded.
