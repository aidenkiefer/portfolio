  "overview": "A production-ready web application that optimizes routes for Divvy bike-share maintenance vans across 600+ stations in Chicago. Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using real-time traffic data and weather conditions to minimize route completion time. Built as a React SPA with sophisticated algorithm implementations and external API integrations.",
